 keyolion_events.2.t: "Sugar Cane Scions"
 keyolion_events.2.d: "With the weight of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent election, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] lately found comfort in silent walks along the shore of Keyolion. Today, one worry occupied her mind. It began with the story of their origin, passed from generation to generation:\n\n'While the other Nekheis were founded mostly with profit in mind, Keyolion was a utilitarian need. Our mother city - Oktikheion, tucked between the hills, never had the space available to the other Kheis. This resulted in most of the population concentrating on the coast. As a result, wind-warded Oktikheion grew too dense for comfort. News from the other Kheions reached us - of their colonies on the mainland, free from the deathly winds. Plans were quickly underway. Despite not being among the first to set up settlements, we were welcomed by untapped land that we could call home.'\n\nOn Devand, they found themselves in a similar predicament. The Hsamazh mountain range extended nearly to the cape of Poroga. Keyolion, much like its mother kheis, would soon grow too dense for its confines and when that happened, the state would have to be ready. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s proposal and the reason for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] election was her initiative to improve the land outside of the kheis. Already a new settlement on the coast was being worked on. \n\nBut this was where [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] problems began. The coasts around them were already claimed. The Keyolioni had inherited one thing from their mother kheion - the expertise to grow great sugar cane - something, which the mountains were ill suited for. Once the coast was fully settled and cultivated, where would they then go?"
 keyolion_events.2.a: "Only time will tell."

 keyolion_events.11.a: "Invest in Amgremos."
 keyolion_events.11.b: "Invest in Apikhoxi."

 keyolion_events.12.t: "The Delegation to Empkeios"
 keyolion_events.12.d: "We have made a profitable trade deal, fought for our freedom, kept our alliance/good relations and conquered the rest of the nekheis. We have proven to be capable administrators, diplomats and soldiers. We should rule over Empkeios and protect them."
 keyolion_events.12.a: "One Nekhei to rule them all."

 keyolion_events.104.d: "How Keyolíon has conquered all of the other Nekheis. They're now approaching us asking for our subjugation. They believe they are the rightful rulers of Devand. Refusing will probably make them try to achieve their goals militarily."

Under our guidance and through standardized building requirements, we transformed their bland cities into multi-story, modern urban centers. These new style buildings made of brick and decorated generously with glass windows bring an influx of visitors from Alecand, marveling at our glorious architecture.
